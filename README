Design Notes
============

This web application was designed for hosted ContentDM systems running Windows NT/IIS 6.0. Since 
IIS 6 does not support URL rewrites, (an idea implemented in Apache since 1996) I was forced to 
create a directory structure that mimics the resource paths. As such, friendly URLs are not possible.
