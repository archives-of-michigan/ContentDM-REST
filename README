Overview
========

This is a RESTful interface for ContentDM, intended for deployment on hosted ContentDM systems.  This 
api only provides access to collections for now, but will eventually include items and search results.

Route Structure
===============
cdmhost.com
  GET /
    * href to collections
  GET /?q=/collections
    * href ul of collections
    * json array of collections
  GET /?q=/collections/p123432
    * collection json object
    
Coming soon (routes subject to change):

  GET /?q=/collections/p123432&search=foo
    * search for items
  GET /?q=/collections/p123432/items/9878
    * collection item json object
  GET /?q=/collections/p123432/items/9878/subitem/46464
    * collection item json object - compound object item

Design Notes
============

This web application was designed for hosted ContentDM systems running Windows NT/IIS 6.0. Since 
IIS 6 does not support URL rewrites, (an idea implemented in Apache since 1996) I updated Konstrukt 
(the underlying framework providing REST) to allow resources to be accessed using the front controller 
pattern used by Wordpress, Drupal, et al.  For instance, since /collections/p1234 is not allowed by 
IIS by default, you can instead request /index.php?q=/collections/p1234. Any proxying webserver can 
rewrite friendly urls into this front-controller format.
