Design Notes
============

This web application was designed for hosted ContentDM systems running Windows NT/IIS. Since 
IIS has not until very recently (IIS 8) supported URL rewrites, (an idea implemented in Apache 
since 1996) I was forced to create a directory structure that mimics the resource paths.
